A hotel management smart contract is a self-executing code on a blockchain network that automates hotel operations and transactions, providing secure, transparent, and tamper-proof management of room bookings, payments, and customer data.

## Getting Started

To use this smart contract, you will need a platform that supports smart contract deployment and execution, such as Ethereum. You will also need a tool such as Remix or Truffle to deploy and test the contract.

## Features

- Room booking: Customers can book a room by calling the `bookRoom()` function, which will store the customer's details and room preference on the blockchain.
- Room cancellation: Customers can cancel a room booking by calling the `cancelBooking()` function, which will remove the customer's details and room preference from the blockchain.
- Payment processing: Customers can pay for their room using cryptocurrency by calling the `makePayment()` function, which will deduct the payment amount from the customer's wallet and transfer it to the hotel's wallet.
- Room availability: The contract maintains a record of available rooms, which can be viewed by calling the `getAvailableRooms()` function.
- Room occupancy: The contract maintains a record of occupied rooms, which can be viewed by calling the `getOccupiedRooms()` function.
- Room rates: The contract maintains a record of room rates, which can be viewed by calling the `getRoomRates()` function.

## Security

This smart contract ensures secure and tamper-proof management of hotel operations and transactions by leveraging the inherent security features of the blockchain. By storing all data on the blockchain, the contract eliminates the need for a centralized database, which is susceptible to hacking and other security breaches. Additionally, the use of cryptocurrency for payments ensures secure and efficient payment processing.

## Transparency

This smart contract provides transparent management of hotel operations and transactions by making all data publicly accessible on the blockchain. Customers can view the availability of rooms, room rates, and their own booking details at any time. The contract also ensures that all transactions are immutable and cannot be altered or deleted.
